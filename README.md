# SparkLock
Featured Project: SparkLock
SparkLock is an AI-powered smart fire prevention system designed to prevent home fires before they start. It combines advanced technology across multiple platforms to provide comprehensive fire safety solutions.
Mobile App for Users: Citizens can monitor their homes, receive real-time alerts, and take preventive actions to avoid potential fire hazards.
Web Platform for Fire Brigades: Fire organizations can access critical data, track incidents, and coordinate rapid responses to prevent fire escalation.

Embedded System: Integrated hardware sensors detect sparks, smoke, or unusual temperature changes, allowing the system to take immediate preventive actions and communicate with the mobile and web platforms.
The Problem
Every year, fires caused by hidden wiring, gas leaks, and overheated circuits steal thousands of lives and billions in property.
68% of electrical home fires start in hidden areas like walls and ceilings.
Most households lack early-warning systems, leading to permanent damage once a fire starts.
Our Solution
SparkLock is an integrated system that uses Local Edge AI to monitor home safety in real-time.

Detection: Monitors for electrical overloads, short circuits, arc faults, gas leaks, and kitchen flames.
Autonomous Action: Cuts power and gas in milliseconds when a hazard is detected.
Real-Time Alerts: Notifies the owner via a mobile app and sends GPS location data to the fire brigade for immediate response.
🛠️ Technology & Architecture
Our system relies on a multi-layered sensor approach:

PCM (Per-Circuit Modules): Monitors for electrical faults.
KSM (Kitchen Safety Modules): Detects gas and flames.
SparkLock Hub: Processes data locally using AI for trend prediction and logging.

Impact & Alignment
We aim to build a safer Rwanda by aligning with:

Rwanda’s NST2 Goals: Supporting smart infrastructure.
Global SDGs: Innovating for sustainable cities and community safety.
Key Partners: Collaborating with the Rwanda National Police, RURA, and the Rwanda Energy Group (REG).
